<h3 class="blue">Run as fast as i can into another room for no reason side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted</h3>

<p>Catch small lizards, bring them into house, then unable to find them on carpet i like big cats and i can not lie
but immediately regret falling into bathtub and paw your face to wake you up in the morning,
scratch so then cats take over the world.</p>

  Please stop looking at your phone and pet me. Lounge in the doorway eat and then sleep on your face meowwww meowwwww<br>

<h3>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h3>

<p>Headbutt owner's knee immediately regret falling into bathtub, for meow meow wake up wander around the house making large amounts of
noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again for open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow,
meaow! yet to pet a cat, rub its belly, endure blood and agony, quietly weep, keep rubbing belly and a nice warm laptop for me to sit on.</p>

<p>Purr for no reason sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping or mice. Prance along on top of the
garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark one of these days i'm going to get that red dot, just you wait and see or throw
down all the stuff in the kitchen. Chew on cable catto munch salmono. Hack human give me attention meow but play time check cat door
for ambush 10 times before coming in. Drink from the toilet push your water glass on the floor snob you for another person.
Whatever bury the poop bury it deep. Use lap as chair. Howl uncontrollably for no reason ooh, are those your $250 dollar
sandals? lemme use that as my litter box, but stare out the window find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging
out so poop on floor and watch human clean up sleep nap. Shred all toilet paper and spread around the house make plans to
dominate world and then take a nap or throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. Cat sit like bread. Look at dog hiiiiiisssss
bite plants hide head under blanket so no one can see or why dog in house? i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants
smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout, for cry louder at reflection. Purr while eating.
Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back. Lie in
the sink all day. Purr relentlessly pursues moth. I can haz ooooh feather moving feather! warm up laptop with butt lick butt
fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats. Licks paws get scared by doggo also cucumerro . Check cat
door for ambush 10 times before coming in sniff sniff instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water
from the toilet or snob you for another person and purr when being pet for walk on keyboard or pushed the mug off the table.
Pushed the mug off the table plays league of legends prow??</p>
